================================
LD4KD2015
2nd Workshop on Linked Data for Knowledge Discovery

http://events.kmi.open.ac.uk/ld4kd2015/

co-located with the European Conference on Machine Learning and
Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery 2015 (ECML/PKDD 2015)
September 7th - 11th 2015, Porto, Portugal
(http://www.ecmlpkdd2015.org/ )

================================

Linked Data have attracted a lot of attention in recent years, as the
underlying technologies and principles provide new ways, following the
Semantic Web standards, to overcome typical data management and
consumption issues such as reliability, heterogeneity, provenance or
completeness.  However, the way in which Linked Data can be applicable
and beneficial to the Knowledge Discovery (KDD) process is still not
completely understood.  Many aspects of KDD could in fact benefit from
Linked Data, e.g. mining Linked Data sources, using Linked Data to
enrich, represent or integrate local data for data preparation,
interpretation or visualisation.

The LD4KD2015 workshop encourages the participation of researchers from
the Knowledge Discovery field to discuss and get informed about the use,
benefits and challenges of Linked Data, while Linked Data researchers
can take advantage of and adapt Knowledge Discovery methods in their
domain.

*SCOPE*

We welcome high quality position papers, research papers and demos in
which
(1) Linked Data are used as support of Knowledge Discovery processes to
extract useful knowledge, or
(2) Knowledge Discovery techniques are adapted to work and possibly
extend Linked Data.

Topics of either theoretical and applied interest include, but are not
limited to:

- Linked Data for data pre-processing: cleaning, sorting, filtering or
  enrichment
- Linked Data applied to Machine Learning
- Linked Data for pattern extraction and behaviour detection
- Linked Data for pattern interpretation, visualization or optimisation
- Reasoning with patterns and Linked Data
- Reasoning on and extracting knowledge from Linked Data
- Linked Data mining
- Links prediction or links discovery using KDD
- Graph mining in Linked Data
- Interacting with Linked Data for Knowledge Discovery

*IMPORTANT DATES*

Paper submission deadline: Monday, June 29, 2015
Paper acceptance notification: Monday, July 13, 2015
Camera-ready deadline: Monday July 27, 2015
